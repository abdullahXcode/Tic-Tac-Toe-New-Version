# Tic-Tac-Toe New Version

# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe (C++ ASCII Version)

This is a **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in C++.  
It follows strict requirements: only `char` and `bool` variables are used, no arrays or functions, and the game logic is built using `do-while` loops and `if-else` statements.  

The game is played by **two players**:  
- Player 1 â†’ `X`  
- Player 2 â†’ `O`  

The board updates after every move and is displayed using ASCII art.
